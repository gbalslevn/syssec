# Install instructions
1. Create the virtual environment `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the required packages `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (use `py` instead of `python3` on windows) 
4. Run a file with `python3 example_file.py`

Text Mathias if this does not work. Good luck. 

# Updating dependencies
Do `python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt`
